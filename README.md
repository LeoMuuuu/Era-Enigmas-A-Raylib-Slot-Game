Raylib Slot Game: A C++ Coding Exercise


This is a slot game implemented in C++ using the raylib game programming library. It was developed as a coding exercise and makes use of open-source fonts and icons. Please note that this game is intended for personal use only.

Gameplay


The game features three different missions with varied board sizes: 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 grids.
To stop the slot, either hit the space bar or click on the text.

Scoring and Bonuses


You earn bonuses for every connected group of four, five or six (in mission 4, 5, 6) or more identical blocks. Obstacles appearing on the perimeter serve as your countdown to the next mission. Once you eliminate all the obstacles around the first circle of blocks, you advance to the next mission.

Endless Mode


Upon reaching the third mission (the 6x6 grid), the game enters an "endless" mode. This allows you to continue playing indefinitely, aiming for higher scores and bonuses. In the third mission, you'll encounter greater bonus opportunities, providing an exciting challenge as you strive for top scores.

Source Code


The slot.cpp file is in the src folder, feel free to use it for fun, modify it or give any suggestions to make it smarter. You may need a raylib premake package to use this code. Please remember that there're open-source fonts and icons which only allow personal usage.
